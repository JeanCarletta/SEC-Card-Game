Thank you for your interest in our Net Zero Toolkit Cards.

This website it still in preparation, but it gives you a sense of what it will contain.

-  it has no links to resources yet 
-  it is only filled out for the first two "petals" - Energy Efficiency Improvements and 100% Clean Energy.

Each card relates to one task in the Provincial Environment Group's Net Zero Toolkit.  Completing the task means developing a considered view of each card and acting on the ones that will help your congregation reach net zero.

Read "How to Use the Cards" first, and then explore your actions.
