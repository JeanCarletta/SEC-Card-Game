Thank you for your interest in our Net Zero Toolkit Cards.

This website it still in preparation, but it gives you a sense of what it will contain.

Each card relates to one task in the Provincial Environment Group's Net Zero Toolkit.  Completing the task means developing a considered view of each card and acting on the ones that will help your congregation reach net zero.

The cards are best explored in groups of six to eight people.  We suggest you spread the cards on the table and go around the room, allowing people to choose a card in turn and placing them into three areas:

- Actions we should definitely take
- Actions that aren't for us - because we've taken them or they don't suit our building and how we intend to use it in future
- Actions we are unsure about

Leave time at the end of the session to think about what happens next.  For actions you should take, who should do that, and when?  For actions you are unsure about, how will you find more information so you can make a decision?  Do you need more time to think about it together or to take the views of other people?  You may find it helpful to have one person take notes during this part of the session.  We provide a template you can use for this:

 - [Planning template for recording the results of exploring the cards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qiwoNowiUvHmJD5xaN5aZFjLV2M7T4vu/)
 
Some groups prefer to record audio snippets with what they've agreed about each card and have someone fill out the planning template afterwards.

It's good to give people a free choice of cards when they explore the set, but the cards come in groups that have a natural order to them:

- Group 1: Basic Steps
- Group 2: Reduce Energy Demand, part of Energy Efficiency
- Group 3: Address Heat Loss, part of Energy Efficiency
- Group 4: Decarbonise, part of Clean Energy
- Group 5: Generate Energy, part of Clean Energy

Usually taking actions in the order the groups appear leads to the fastest and largest carbon reductions.
