Apply for a Scottish Government’s Community and Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES) grant of up to 80% of eligible costs up to a maximum of £80k.   Although they will only contribute for premises that will be well-used by the local community, they think our workshops will lead you to applications they can get behind even if they don't quite "fit" the description - so don't assume, give them a call!
