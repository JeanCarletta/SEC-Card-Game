<p>Most systems make people warm by heating the air.  If your building lets the warm air escape, that's expensive and bad for the environment.  Measures like insulation can be too expensive if you don't use a space much, or too difficult in fancy buildings. There are other ways to make people warm. You could install radiant "on demand" heating or heated seating, for instance. It's not all or nothing.  You might heat the people in some spaces and the air in others, or both a bit, depending on the circumstances. Just making a deliberate choice is an important step. </p>
