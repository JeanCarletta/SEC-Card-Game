<p>Slim-line double glazing is acceptable in many listed buildings. If you have Victorian windows in a good state, consider refurbishing them and replacing just the glass.  They’ll have as much life left in them as a modern window.  When you choose, think about how ventilation will work for your users.  They can’t use what they can’t reach, but it’s more comfortable if they aren’t right in the draught.  Trickle vents provide finer control in cold weather than opening the window.   </p><p>Triple glazing costs more than double and is only worth it if your walls are well insulated. </p>
