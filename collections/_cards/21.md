<p>If your building serves the community well, it’s easier to afford changes and get grants, and it’s good for mission too. Think about whether your building is as well used as it should be.  If you’re struggling the manage a building that could be used more, you may be able to combine forces with some other group that needs space.  Some groups know the building would be used if they could maintain and market it better, and lease it to a new independent charity that has the energy to make that happen - with them as the first user group.</p>
