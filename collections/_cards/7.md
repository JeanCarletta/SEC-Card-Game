<p>Extractor fans are useful in some spaces to remove moist or stale air, but they also cause heat loss. It’s possible to get extractor fans that recover the heat and put it back into the building by transferring it to fresh air from outside.  This is worth the added cost for fans that are often on.  </p><p> Extractor fans can come on and go off with the lights, come on with the lights but run longer, work from a pull cord, or run automatically based on the relative humidity. The right choice matters and depends on the application.</p>
