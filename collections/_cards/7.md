<p>Twice hourly smart meter readings will help the UK plan and reduce the number of power stations we need.  It should be possible to use a third party app to get the data even if your supplier won’t give it to you.  The data will allow you to spot changes that could signal waste and estimate the cost of energy for room hires.</p><p>A smart meter can also show a ‘Live consumption’ feed which can be really helpful in identifying ‘vampiric’ sockets!</p>
