<p>Twice hourly smart meter readings will help the UK plan and reduce the number of power stations we need.  It should be possible to use a third party app to get the data even if your supplier won’t give it to you.  The data will allow you to spot changes that could signal waste and estimate the cost of energy for room hires. We expect future energy efficiency consultants to give better advice than they can currently - if you can give them the data. </p><p>Some installers are badly trained so you may need to be persistent if it doesn’t work.   </p>
