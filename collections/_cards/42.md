<p>Fluorescent lamps are being phased out.  If you’re using them for anything important, change them urgently.  For high pressure sodium (HPS), LEDs would use 40-75% of the power they do and look better.  Whether that’s an important change depends on how powerful they are and how often you use them. </p><p>When you make a change, think about whether your lights are the right power and in the right place, and also look at the energy efficiency of the LEDs you put in.  New generation LEDs take half the power of the most common ones.  </p>
