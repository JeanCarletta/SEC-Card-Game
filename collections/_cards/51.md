<p>Carbon offsetting is controversial but everyone agrees on one thing:  it should never be used as an excuse for failing to make every carbon reduction possible. If you intend to go this route, take the other cards very seriously and evaluate your choices carefully.  For instance, trees only store carbon temporarily and it can be twenty years before they capture what the schemes promise - if they survive that long.   Sometimes offsetting displaces local communities, funds things that would have happened anyway, or lets someone else claim the same tonne of carbon reduction. PEG recommend that carbon offsetting only be used to counterbalance ‘residual’ emissions – emissions that are left after all reasonable efforts have been exhausted to abate them.</p>
