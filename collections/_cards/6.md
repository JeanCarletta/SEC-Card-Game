<p>Twice hourly smart meter readings will help the UK plan and reduce the number of power stations we need. They have a display you can put somewhere convenient that says how much energy you are using.   It should be possible to use a third party app to get your past data even if your supplier won’t give it to you.  This data will allow you to spot changes that could signal waste and estimate the cost of energy for room hires, and some professionals need it to give you good advice. </p><p>A smart meter can also show a ‘Live consumption’ feed which can be really helpful in identifying ‘vampiric’ sockets!</p>
