<p>There are currently two significant funding streams that are available from the Scottish Government which provide financial help to implement measures outlined in the SEC Net Zero Action Plan. These are the Community And Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES) (which covers up to 80% of the total cost for heat pumps up to a maximum £80K via the Let’s Do Net Zero: Community Buildings Fund) and Business Energy Scotland (with a £100k 8-year interest free loan with up to 75% of total costs up to a maximum of £30k available via cashback for eligible measures per independent charity). Note that in the case of CARES funding you need to demonstrate high community amenity, good occupancy).</p>
