<p>There are currently two significant funding streams available from the Scottish Government which provide financial help to implement measures in these cards. Community And Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES) (which as of writing covers up to 80% of the total cost for heat pumps up to a maximum £80K via the Let’s Do Net Zero Community Buildings Fund) and Business Energy Scotland (with a £100k 8-year interest free loan with up to 75% of total costs up to a maximum of £30k available via cashback for eligible measures per independent charity). Note that CARES funding applications must demonstrate high community amenity and good occupancy.</p>
