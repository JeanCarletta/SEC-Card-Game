<p>When users don’t know who to contact, they take things into their own hands. Even if your controls let them do the right thing, that probably means bringing in space heaters, turning on the oven and hob to warm the space, and blocking exits open with fire extinguishers. You need to know what problems they’re having and to be able to get detailed descriptions if there are issues that a worker needs to sort out for you. If you have occasional or loosely managed groups using your buildings, you may need signage with clear contact details including phone and email. Your charge's Buildings Convenor is the point of contact who would normally perform this role. Consider having a maintenance book to track issues.</p>
