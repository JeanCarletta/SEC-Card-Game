<p>If your building users can set thermostats or thermostatic radiator valves, groups are likely to be in conflict with each other and could bring in space heaters or leave windows open.  They will also turn thermostats all the way up. Look for controls that make change temporary. Second best is reduced range thermostats or limiting pins or covers.  If you have a room thermostat in one room that turns off heating in rooms with other groups,  smart Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs) might help. </p><p>  If your main heating system is very slow, you probably shouldn’t let users turn it on at all. </p>
