<p>If building users don’t feel comfortable, they are likely to take matters into their own hands and fiddle with your carefully timed heating controls, turn up radiators or bring their own plug-in heating. You could limit access to heating controls, install controls for temporary changes and provide user guidance and contact details if they are having difficulty. If this is happening frequently, look at how adjustments can be made to reduce the need for users to seek their own solutions (use the maintenance book to flag the issue). Look for controls that make change temporary. Second best is reduced range thermostats or limiting pins or covers.  If you have a room thermostat in one room that turns off heating in rooms with other groups,  smart Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs) might help. </p><p>  If your main heating system is very slow, you probably shouldn’t let users turn it on at all. </p>
