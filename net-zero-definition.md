Carbon emissions associated with reaching net zero are generally categorised into three types of emissions known as ‘scopes’. 
* Scope 1 emissions are the direct emissions arising from on-site generation of energy in our buildings, vehicles, or land. 
* Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions associated with the use of electricity, heat, steam, and/or cooling.
* Scope 3 emissions are all other indirect emissions that occur in the day to day running of the church’s operations – in other words the purchased goods and services the church uses, its waste, water use as well as reimbursable work-related travel.

For the SEC Net Zero 2023-2030 action plan, we are including all Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as reimbursable travel from scope 3. This is summarised in the graphic below with the dotted lines representing those emissions that should be addressed by 2030. More detail can be found in the Net Zero Action Plan (2023-2030). You can also watch a short webinar about What is Net Zero 2030? Presented by Robert Woodford in December 2022.
