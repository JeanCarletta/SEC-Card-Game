Maintain buildings and keep them dry,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>If a building falls into disrepair, this has a huge carbon cost.  Our most important action is following the advice in your quinquennial survey.   A sound roof with adequate rainwater clearance will also make the building stay warm more easily and feel more comfortable. Ventilation is also important to keep the building dry even in traditional buildings, especially to vent moist air after people have been in. Don’t be tempted to reduce it without taking advice. Ensure work is carried out using breathable materials and maintain your ventilation features, for instance, by clearing leaves from low level air intakes.</p>",It wasn't raining when Noah built the ark.,traditional gospel song,T1.1,5,£££,,,1,3,Basic steps,"""It wasn't raining when Noah built the ark."" ―traditional gospel song OR A stitch in time saves nine. ― proverb",,Good management,Keep the building water tight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Provide maintenance contact details,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>When users don’t know who to contact, they take things into their own hands. Even if your controls let them do the right thing, that probably means bringing in space heaters, turning on the oven and hob to warm the space, and blocking exits open with fire extinguishers. You need to know what problems they’re having and to be able to get detailed descriptions if there are issues that a worker needs to sort out for you. If you have occasional or loosely managed user groups in, you may need signage with a contact number.</p>",It's good to talk,1990s advertising campaign ,T1.1,3,£,,,1,1,Basic steps,"""It's good to talk"" - 1990s advertising campaign ",,Good management,Provide maintenance contact details,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep maintenance records and plan for change,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Planning for change means you won't get caught out when equipment fails.  For electrics, you want new equipment to be as efficient as possible.  Heating takes special care because you want to do things in the right order.  For instance, it’s best to put in underfloor heating when the flooring is being changed, not afterwards.  Good planning requires  maintenance records so you can spot recurring problems and save you scrapping a whole system when one part fails. </p><p>If you still have a non-condensing boiler, you should make planning your next heating system a top priority.</p>",When people can see a vision and simultaneously recognise what can be done step by step... they will begin to feel encouragement and enthusiasm., Erich Fromm ,T1.1,,,,,1,,Basic steps,"“When people can see a vision and simultaneously recognise what can be done step by step... they will begin to feel encouragement and enthusiasm.” Erich Fromm  OR “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” ― Benjamin Franklin ",add,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Create a draught lobby,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Heat is lost when doors and windows are opened to the outside. By providing sufficient space for the outer door to be closed before opening the inner door, the draught lobby functions a bit like an air lock. If you need to have both doors open at the same time, a draught lobby won’t help.</p><p>Draught lobbies can be either inside the building - essentially adding a vestibule - or outside. Often they are made in glass to avoid the building becoming less welcoming and incorporate automatic doors to save energy and make the building more accessible.</p>",It always seems impossible until it's done., Nelson Mandela,T1.10,2,£££,space,,1,3,Address heat loss,"""It always seems impossible until it's done."" ― Nelson Mandela",,Heat loss measures,Create a draught lobby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Close doors between heated and unheated spaces,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>It’s obvious why this makes sense - the hard part is understanding why the doors are open.   If users just forget to close the door, a cheap hydraulic door closer might help.  If groups feel it must be open to welcome people, you might be able to install a glass panel so newcomers can see what is happening inside the space.   If users struggle to enter the space unaided, then you will need either a more expensive automatic door or to station someone at the door to help. </p>","Let us make our future now, and let us make our dreams tomorrow's reality.",Malala Yousafzai,T1.10,2,££,space,,1,2,Address heat loss,"""Let us make our future now, and let us make our dreams tomorrow's reality."" ― Malala Yousafzai",,Heat loss measures,Close doors automatically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Draughtproof the building,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Draughts let cold air in and make people uncomfortable.  Consider windows including cracked glass, doors, loft hatches, holes from previous extractor fans, and gaps around pipework, in floorboards, and under skirting boards. Professionals have access to better materials and skills than you do. Draughtproofing windows is expensive but can make all the difference.</p><p>Blocking up original ventilation features could make your building damp - if you think they let in too much air, take professional advice.

Improve or install extractor fans,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Extractor fans are useful in some spaces to remove moist or stale air, but they also cause heat loss. It’s possible to get extractor fans that recover the heat and put it back into the building by transferring it to fresh air from outside.  This is worth the added cost for fans that are often on.  </p><p> Extractor fans can come on and go off with the lights, come on with the lights but run longer, work from a pull cord, or run automatically based on the relative humidity.

Add close-fitting thermal curtains or blinds,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Thermal curtains and blinds cut draughts and block cold surfaces from making people uncomfortable.  The cheapest option is tightly woven or  foam-backed lined curtains that fit well.  More expensive options perform better because they use fancier materials or trap air movement by adding a box at the top or are blinds that attach to the window frame.  Some home sewers can make cheap but effective curtains and blinds.  </p><p> You can put a curtain on a fire exit to help during a building’s warmup, but it must be left open when people are in. </p>","Heavy, lined curtains... can reduce heat loss [ from single-glazed sash windows] by 14%",Historic Environment Scotland advice web page,T1.10,2,£££,,,1,3,Address heat loss,"""Heavy, lined curtains... can reduce heat loss [ from single-glazed sash windows] by 14%.""  — Historic Environment Scotland advice web page",,Windows,Close fitting thermal curtains or blinds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get the ventilation right,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Most buildings have lots of ways to control the ventilation and assume people will be sensible, for instance, closing vents while a space warms up and opening them to release moist air when people leave.  Help your users know what to do.  You may want to add features like window trickle vents to make things easier, or consider our extractor fan card.  </p><p> If you don’t know how much ventilation you need, your nose, or a relative humidity sensor, will tell you.

Place foil behind radiators,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>If a radiator is mounted on a cold external wall, it will lose much of the heat to the wall, not to the air in the room. There are products you can mount behind these radiators with foil on one side and insulation on the other. They help by reflecting the heat back into the room.   It’s nowhere near as good as insulating the wall, but at least it’s cheap and easy to do while you organise bigger changes.</p>",The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.,Lao Tzu,T1.11,2,£,space,,1,1,Address heat loss,"""The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step."" ― Lao Tzu",,Small heating changes,Place foil behind radiators,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Insulate under the ground floor,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>The heat lost through floors is usually less than through other surfaces, but because people touch the floor, it has a big effect on their comfort. Even carpets help some.  For suspended timber floors, breatheability matters.  Consider hemp batting hung in nets under the joists or breatheable boards lain on runners attached to the joists.  Some floorboards might have to come up temporarily to add them.  </p><p>Solid floors generally lose less heat than suspended ones. Concrete and other floors that can’t be lifted are either insulated over the top, creating a step up, or when the floor needs replaced. </p>",You must be the change you wish to see in the world.,Mahatma Gandhi,T1.11,4,£££,space,,1,3,Address heat loss,"""You must be the change you wish to see in the world."" ― Mahatma Gandhi",,Heat loss measures,Insulate under the ground floor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Insulate the roof,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>In an uninsulated building, the roof is usually the first insulation action to take. You could create a “cold roof” by laying insulation above the ceiling of the top floor, leaving the loft space cold and well-ventilated, or a “warm roof” by placing rigid boards between and over the roof rafters. As always, in traditional buildings breatheability matters.  Cold roof designs save more energy because they are more effective and reduce the heated space.  If your roof can’t be insulated, you may be able to install a false ceiling and insulate above that.</p>","Press forward.

Insulate the walls,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Wall insulation can be outside, inside, or in the cavity within the wall.  The right way to insulate a wall depends on the context.   If you can insulate externally, that’s usually the most effective solution.  With traditional mass masonry walls, you need the insulation to be breathable and there are more options than you might think.  You could have cellulose pellets blown behind the lathe and plaster, insulation applied to the existing masonry, plaster, or wall linings, or a timber frame that holds insulation in place, making a big space a bit smaller.</p>",The biggest human temptation is to settle for too little.,Thomas Merton,T1.11,4,£££,space,,1,3,Address heat loss,“The biggest human temptation is to settle for too little.” — Thomas Merton,,Heat loss measures,Insulate the walls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Insulate hot pipes and tanks,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>You don’t want to lose heat to the wrong spaces.  Unless your pipes are contributing useful heating, they should be insulated, including in the boiler room.  A good installer will insulate all the tricky bits of pipework, not just the straight lengths.</p><p>  It’s also important to insulate hot water cylinders.  Modern cylinders often have hardened foam insulation but older ones might need more.  The modern standard is 80mm.  You can “top up” with a cylinder jacket of the right size.  </p>","Never lose an opportunity of urging a practical beginning, however small.", Florence Nightingale,T1.11,2,££,space,,1,2,Address heat loss,"“Never lose an opportunity of urging a practical beginning, however small.” ― Florence Nightingale",,Heat loss measures,Insulate heating pipework,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Make seats, floors, and walls warmer with carpets, cushions, and tapestries",Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Historically, soft furnishings have been used to reduce the impact of really cold surfaces.  This works because fabrics warm up much faster than stone and present a warmer surface that doesn't soak up your body heat so quickly.  Carpets, seat cushions, wall tapestries, and chairs that cocoon the sitter to get between their head and the ceiling are all approaches that have stood the test of time.  Of course it's not like having central heating, but they do help.</p>",Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible.,Francis of Assisi,T1.11,,,,,1,FALSE,Address heat loss,“Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible.” — Francis of Assisi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Replace single glazing with double or triple,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Slim-line double glazing is acceptable in many listed buildings. If you have Victorian windows in a good state, consider refurbishing them and replacing just the glass.  They’ll have as much life left in them as a modern window.  When you choose, think about how ventilation will work for your users.  They can’t use what they can’t reach, but it’s more comfortable if they aren’t right in the draught.  Trickle vents provide finer control in cold weather than opening the window.   </p><p>Triple glazing costs more than double and is only worth it if your walls are well insulated. </p>","Where the glazing... is not historically significant, double glazing units such as slimline can often be fitted into the existing window frames.",Historic Environment Scotland advisory standard,T1.12,4,£££££,,,1,5,Address heat loss,"""Where the glazing... is not historically significant, double glazing units such as slimline can often be fitted into the existing window frames."" — Historic Environment Scotland advisory standard",,Windows,Replace single glazing with double or triple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Install secondary glazing,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Secondary glazing can be a very good option in some buildings, especially if changes to the original single glazing are not allowed. It has the advantage of improving the window draughtproofing - in some installations ventilation in winter can be supplied just by opening the secondary glazing a crack. It’s generally cheaper than double glazing but perhaps half as effective. A lot depends on how well the windows fit and the distance between the panes. 12mm is the ideal for heat loss, although a bigger distance is better for noise reduction. </p>","Surely we all have a responsibility to care for our Blue Planet.

Install temporary secondary glazing,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>If you don’t need to open the windows in winter for ventilation, it is possible to cut polycarbonate sheets to the size of the window reveal and mount them inside, for instance, using magnetic tape. A good polycarbonate should last ten years without discolouring.  It scratches and you’ll need to find a place to store it in the summer if you can’t leave it up.  This isn’t as good as proper glazing, but it will make a noticeable difference to single glazing especially if the windows don’t fit well.  </p>",Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little.,Edmund Burke,T1.12,2,££,,,1,2,Address heat loss,“Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little.” ― Edmund Burke,,Windows,Install temporary secondary glazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adjust how you worship,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Some churches have already decided that the best-dressed worshippers are wearing blankets.  Others are rethinking the convention that only women and bishops wear hats indoors and wondering how the congregation would feel about processional hymns.  One church hierarchy is wondering whether they can require all congregations to worship in their halls December to February - it’s more intimate and suits some people better.  If nothing else, perhaps this card will lead to some interesting conversations about how we worship and why.</p>",Change is the law of life.

Change to localised heating,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>It’s expensive and difficult to heat air and keep it in an old leaky building.  Even if your building is so well used you can afford heat loss measures, your building could be difficult to treat.  Try the infrared panel and heated seating cards plus approaches that reduce the impact of really cold surfaces, like carpets, curtains and wall hangings. Although these do heat the air some, they mostly make people comfortable through radiation or conduction, so they reduce draughts and make heat loss much less important. Running costs are also proportional to space use, reducing financial risk.</p>",The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world that it leaves to its children.,Dietrich Bonhoeffer,T1.2,,,,yes,1,FALSE,Basic steps,"  “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.” — Yogi Berra or “The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world that it leaves to its children.” ― Dietrich Bonhoeffer",add,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Share your building,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>If your building serves the community well, it’s easier to afford changes and get grants, and it’s good for mission too. Think about whether your building is as well used as it should be.  If you’re struggling the manage a building that could be used more, you may be able to combine forces with some other group that needs space.  Some groups know the building would be used if they could maintain and market it better, and lease it to a new independent charity that has the energy to make that happen - with them as the first user group.</p>",...gonna try with a little help from my friends,The Beatles,T1.2,,,,yes,1,FALSE,Basic steps,"""...gonna try with a little help from my friends.""  ― The Beatles or ""We all have to live together, so we might as well live together happily.""  ― Dalai Lama or We have all known the long loneliness, and we have found that the answer is community. ― Dorothy Day",add,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get energy assessments for your buildings,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>A professional assessment will help you prioritise your actions - but keep in mind the assessors can't always tailor their advice to how you use your building or how that might change in the future.  For your housing,  you should obtain an up-to-date EPC survey and also review guidance on the Scottish Episcopal Church's minimum standards for rectories.  For other modest buildings, you could use a free energy efficiency assessment from Business Energy Scotland. For larger, listed buildings you may wish to consider getting a survey by a qualified Mechanical and Electrical Engineer via the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. </p>","Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has",Margaret Mead,T1.3,,,,,1,FALSE,Basic steps,"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. ― Margaret Mead",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get smart meters,Energy Efficiency Excellence,<p>Twice hourly smart meter readings will help the UK plan and reduce the number of power stations we need.  It should be possible to use a third party app to get the data even if your supplier won’t give it to you.  The data will allow you to spot changes that could signal waste and estimate the cost of energy for room hires.

Check your thermostat and its location,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Many community buildings have thermostats or temperature sensors that don’t work because they are on a very cold wall or in a corner without good airflow.  It’s also common to find wired ones that are no longer wired in and wireless ones with flat batteries.  If your space ever overheats, you’ll want to check this.  A flat battery can also cause some systems to come on permanently or using a default heating schedule.</p>",Faith is taking the first step even when you don’t see the whole staircase.  ,Martin Luther King Jr.,T1.4,1,£,space,,1,1,Reduce energy demand,Faith is taking the first step even when you don’t see the whole staircase.  ― Martin Luther King Jr.,add,Small heating changes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Check your frost arrangements,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Heating a building to preserve it is a last resort.  Most wet heating systems can protect themselves by turning on just the pumps or warming the water very gently. Keeping the building dry and well-ventilated is often enough for the building and its contents, especially if you can insulate any vulnerable water pipes.  Your architect can advise you.  If you really  have to introduce heat, it’s much more efficient to install controls that will enforce a minimum “setback” temperature than to turn the heating on a little bit every day.  </p>","It ain't the heat, it's the humility.",Yogi Berra,T1.4,1,£,,,1,1,Reduce energy demand,"“It ain't the heat, it's the humility.” — Yogi Berra",,Small heating changes,Check your frost arrangements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fix a cold radiator,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>If a radiator is too cold to the touch and not heating a room enough, you or your installer may have turned up the boiler thermostat or increased the pump speed to compensate - or your users might find their own energy-wasting ways to cope.  It’s better to find out why the radiator is cold in the first place.  A broken TRV, stuck valve, air or sludge in the radiator, a faulty pump, or an unbalanced system can all cause this problem.</p>",Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies., Mother Teresa,T1.4,1,££,space,,1,2,Reduce energy demand,"""Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies."" ― Mother Teresa",,Small heating changes,Fix a cold radiator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Review heating and hot water timings,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Lots of buildings waste energy by not matching the heating well enough to when people are in.  In addition, turning the heating off well before the last people leave means the system won’t waste energy trying to bring the space back up to temperature just because the door has been open.  If you struggle to get the timings right with your current system, consider updating your heating controls.  Some models let you set the times over the internet and “optimised start control” would mean you don’t have to predict how long the space will take to warm up.</p>",Timeliness is best in all matters.,Hesiod,T1.4,2,£,,,1,1,Reduce energy demand,"""Timeliness is best in all matters."" ― Hesiod",,Small heating changes,Review heating and hot water timings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Change how users influence the heating,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>If your building users can set thermostats or thermostatic radiator valves, groups are likely to be in conflict with each other and could bring in space heaters or leave windows open.  They will also turn thermostats all the way up. Look for controls that make change temporary. Second best is reduced range thermostats or limiting pins or covers.  If you have a room thermostat in one room that turns off heating in rooms with other groups,  smart TRVs might help. </p><p>  If your main heating system is very slow, you probably shouldn’t let users turn it on at all. </p>","Harmony makes small things grow, lack of it makes great things decay.",Sallust,T1.5,2,£,,,1,1,Reduce energy demand,"""Harmony makes small things grow, lack of it makes great things decay.""  ― Sallust OR  ""Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces."" ― Psalm 122:7 ",,Small heating changes,Limit your thermostats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disable the heating in summer,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>The best way to be sure you aren’t using any gas or electricity for heating is to turn the heating completely off, especially if your users can bring the heating on. Radiators are a popular way of warming croissants in all seasons.   Even if your users don’t bring on the heating, your system might.

Turn down your boiler thermostat,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Condensing boilers can’t recover wasted heat unless the flow temperature is around 70C or below. The lower the flow temperature, down to 45C, the better the heat recovery works and sometimes the gentler heat is more comfortable.  Lowering the flow temperature is more likely to work for buildings with generously sized radiators, low heat loss, and longer heating periods.  The lower the setting, the earlier you have to turn on the heating, so you’ll need to experiment to find the most efficient setting.  </p><p>  Non-condensing boilers and ones that feed hot water tanks should be run at 70C or above. </p>","The aim of the game is to Limbo, And see how low can you go",Chubby Checker,T1.6,2,£,space,,1,1,Reduce energy demand,"""The aim of the game is to Limbo, And see how low can you go"" ― Chubby Checker",,Small heating changes,Turn down your boiler thermostat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Update your boiler controls,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Most systems don’t have modern energy efficiency controls, but they can be cheap enough they’re even used in houses.  If you are heating the building based on an event schedule, you probably want “optimised start control”.  This  learns when to turn the heating on depending on the weather. If you heat for longer periods or most of the day, “weather compensation” is more appropriate so the system runs cooler when it’s warm out.  If your spaces warm quickly, you might benefit from “load compensation”, which slows the heating down as it reaches temperature so it won’t overshoot.</p>",The Church welcomes technological progress and receives it with love,Pope Pius XII,T1.6,3,£££,space,,1,3,Reduce energy demand,“The Church welcomes technological progress and receives it with love” ― Pope Pius XII,,Small heating changes,Update your heating controls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Turn off hot water preheat,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>On a combi-boiler, “hot water preheat” keeps a bit of water hot at all times. It makes the water in your tap run hot faster.  If you’re lucky, there’s an “Eco” button on your boiler to turn it off.  If your building users then complain, an electrician could link it to the heating timings.  If you have high hot water demand, you might also benefit from a CombiSave to restrict water flow until it’s hot.</p><p>Usually hot water delay is because of the distance between boiler and tap.

If it’s not possible to insulate the roof, false ceilings can be doubly attractive as it might be possible to insulate them in a “cold roof” design. </p><p> Similarly, if you have no option but to put small groups in large spaces, finding a way to partition them into smaller ones - either permanently or as needed - can reduce your heating bills and might increase your income.

Force the lights or heating off when no one is in,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Lights in community buildings are frequently left on by accident. If the light switch also controls an extractor fan, this can waste a lot of heating. </p><p>Some lights and fans have motion sensing built in. For others, you can have an electrician add a separate motion sensor.  They can sense movement up to 30 feet away, so can be used in relatively large rooms, and don’t take much power to run. Alternatively, if electric heating also gets left on, you could change to hotel-style keycards that control whether electricity is supplied to some circuits.</p>","Come on baby, do the locomotion",Gerry Coffin and Carole King,T1.8,2,££,,,1,2,Reduce energy demand,"""Come on baby, do the locomotion"" — Gerry Coffin and Carole King",,Electricity,Install motion sensors for some electrics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Put countdown timers on some electrics,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Electric heating and urns often get left on, even overnight.  You can buy special “countdown timer” or “time delay push” switches that will only supply electricity to a device for a set amount of time before the user will need to use the switch again. Sometimes you set the amount of time for the switch and sometimes the switch gives the user several choices - for instance, power for 1, 2, or 3 hours. If a bunch of electrical devices should come on together, consider having one switch for them all.</p>","The future starts today, not tomorrow", Pope John Paul II,T1.8,3,££,,,1,2,Reduce energy demand,"""The future starts today, not tomorrow.""  ― Pope John Paul II",,Electricity,Put countdown timers on some electrics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Update your lighting,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Fluorescent lamps are being phased out.  If you’re using them for anything important, change them urgently.  For high pressure sodium (HPS), LEDs would use 40-75% of the power they do and look better.  Whether that’s an important change depends on how powerful they are and how often you use them. </p><p>When you make a change, think about whether your lights are the right power and in the right place, and also look at the energy efficiency of the LEDs you put in.  New generation LEDs take half the power of the most common ones.  </p>","Each one of us matters, has a role to play, and makes a difference.

Change to point-of-use hot water on demand,Energy Efficiency Excellence,"<p>Electric point-of-use hot water heaters only heat the hot water you need on demand. That’s a good change if you have an old, badly insulated tank that could fail soon or if you can’t predict when hot water is needed.  It can also be good if you have a condensing boiler that you are only running at high temperature to keep the tank safe, or if there aren’t many taps and they’re a long way from the tank.  If your hot water heating is currently on a timer, at least make sure the times are right for you.</p>",No problem can withstand the assault of sustained thinking.,Voltaire,T1.9,3,££,,,1,2,Reduce energy demand,"""No problem can withstand the assault of sustained thinking."" ― Voltaire",,Big heating changes,Remove a hot water tank,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Install heated seating,100% Clean Energy,"<p>One way of making people comfortable is applying heat to the people instead of trying to heat the entire space - like with heated car seats. Some churches are moving to heated pew cushions. There are both small rechargeable ones and ones that are wired permanently into the mains.  You can also get panel heaters that mount vertically on, for instance, the back of pews and on altars.</p>",The hotter body's heat will pass to the cooler...that's a physical law!,Flanders and Swann,T2.1,5,££££,,,2,4,Decarbonise,"""The hotter body's heat will pass to the cooler...that's a physical law!""  ― Flanders and Swann",,Big heating changes,Install heated seating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Add or switch to infrared heating,100% Clean Energy,"<p>If you can’t address heat loss, it doesn’t make sense to try to heat the air and keep it in the building.  Instead, you could install infrared panels that act like mini suns for use just when people are in.  There are churches that use them successfully as the sole heating in worship spaces, halls, and offices.  The system must be carefully designed with the right wave length for the space, and it works better if the furniture doesn’t block the heat.</p>",…people have felt warm throughout the coldest months… [the energy cost] is so low that it's just a no-brainer,"Andrew Wood, treasurer, St Matthew's Bristol, after their switch ",T2.1,3,££££,,,2,4,Decarbonise,"""…people have felt warm throughout the coldest months… [the energy cost] is so low that it's just a no-brainer""  ― Andrew Wood, treasurer, St Matthew's Bristol, after their switch ",,Big heating changes,Add or switch to infrared heating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Replace your boiler with a heat pump,100% Clean Energy,"<p>Heat pumps take heat from the outside air or ground using the same kind of technology as refrigerators, but in reverse. Installing pumps is expensive but there are grants available and if you can raise the costs, the running costs make it worth it.  They usually warm water but they can warm the air directly.   You may need underfloor heating unless you have low heat loss, generous radiators, and pipework big enough to deliver the  heat using lower temperature water than on your old system.  </p>",There are better ways to power our future than by digging fossil fuel from the ground and setting it on fire.,Frances Beinecke,T2.1,5,£££££,space,,2,5,Decarbonise,"""There are better ways to power our future than by digging fossil fuel from the ground and setting it on fire."" ― Frances Beinecke",,Big heating changes,Replace your boiler with a heat pump,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Connect to a heating district network,100% Clean Energy,"<p>In district heating, the heat is generated elsewhere in the neighbourhood and delivered via insulated pipes. You may be able to find information about plans for future low carbon heating networks for your city or local region that use waste heat from electricity generation or industrial processes, or low carbon technologies with efficiencies of scale.  Expect an expensive building retrofit. Just like a heat pump, district heating delivers heat at lower temperatures than our current boilers, so it often requires underfloor heating and good use of heat loss measures. </p>",A problem shared is a problem halved.,proverb,T2.1,3,£££££,space,,2,5,Decarbonise,"""A problem shared is a problem halved.""  ― proverb OR  ""Let the train take the strain."" - advertising slogan",,Big heating changes,Connect to a heating district network,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Turn sunshine into electricity,100% Clean Energy,"<p>Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels generate electricity for immediate use, battery storage, or sale to the grid.  For most community buildings they make more sense than using panels to heat water.  If your roof is weak, high up, has lots of obstacles, or is the wrong orientation or wrong slope, maybe you have enough space for ground mounted panels.  On a roof, think about the impact on rainwater clearance.  Solar slates are coming but are expensive and still have teething problems.  </p><p>If finance is an issue, there are solar cooperatives that might be willing to take your site on.</p>","The first rule of sustainability is to align with natural forces, or at least not try to defy them.",Paul Hawken,T2.3,5,££££,,,2,4,Generate energy,"“The first rule of sustainability is to align with natural forces, or at least not try to defy them.” Paul Hawken",,Generation,Install photovoltaic solar panels on your roof,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Offset your carbon use,Positive Finances,"<p>Carbon offsetting is controversial but everyone agrees on one thing:  it should never be used as an excuse for failing to make every carbon reduction possible. If you intend to go this route, take the other cards very seriously and evaluate your choices carefully.  For instance, trees only store carbon temporarily and it can be twenty years before they capture what the schemes promise - if they survive that long.   Sometimes offsetting displaces local communities, funds things that would have happened anyway, or lets someone else claim the same tonne of carbon reduction.  </p>",The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.,Robert Swan,T9.3,,,,yes,9,FALSE,Positive finances,"“The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.” Robert Swan OR You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.  ― Abraham Lincoln or ""Practice what you preach.""",add,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
