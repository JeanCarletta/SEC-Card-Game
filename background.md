The Scottish Episcopal Church is a diverse church, with a wide range of different circumstances in different places. No one set of actions would suit every charge, but the Anglican Communion’s Five Marks of Mission are a common set of principles for the whole church. These principles will help to shape the vision of discipleship, justice and hope which is offered as the basis of the Net Zero Action Plan, and therefore underpin the approach in the Toolkit too. We hope that this will inform you and enable you to embed the principles in your own reflections and the steps you, your Diocese and Charge will be taking between now and 2030.

In 2020, the General Synod of the Scottish Episcopal Church, recognising the climate emergency which the planet is facing, called for the whole church to work towards a target of achieving Net Zero carbon emissions by 2030. The Church in Society Committee worked with commitment and diligence to develop an action plan and, the following year, the Synod endorsed ten points of guidance and a programme of actions to help the Church on the way to becoming a cleaner, greener church, and put in place structures to support, resource and encourage us along the way. As a result of this programme of actions the Provincial Environment Group was formed to advise the Standing Committee of the Scottish Episcopal Church on how to move forward. The Net Zero Action Plan 2023-2030 has been developed in consultation across the Province. During that consultation it became apparent that updating and aligning the existing Toolkit would be of great benefit to many charges. This version of the Toolkit is envisioned as a ‘live’ document that will be added to regularly.

The necessary changes encompass almost all aspects of our church: not only our buildings where we use the energy created from the burning of fossil fuels, but in every area of our life, work and worship. We do not underestimate the challenge, but there are many steps we can take which will make a difference and we need to plan now for the bigger challenge, so that they can be met within the desired timeframe. It must be done step by step and needs to cover church lands, buildings, halls, offices, and rectories, transport and church activities. Each church’s plan of action will be unique to their situation.
