# Defining Net Zero 2030 
Net zero in simple terms is where the greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere are balanced by their removal out of the atmosphere. Carbon emissions are generally categorised into three types of emissions known as ‘scopes’. Scope 1 emissions are the direct emissions arising from on-site generation of energy in our buildings, vehicles, or land. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions associated with the use of electricity, heat, steam, and/or cooling. Scope 3 emissions are all other indirect emissions that occur in the day to day running of the church’s operations – in other words the purchased goods and services the church uses, its waste, water use as well as reimbursable work-related travel.
