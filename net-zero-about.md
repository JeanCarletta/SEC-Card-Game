Net zero in simple terms is where the greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere are balanced by their removal out of the atmosphere. This is crucial for stopping climate change because GHGs, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and contribute to global warming. By achieving net zero emissions, we can significantly slow down the rate of climate change and reduce its severe impacts, such as rising temperatures, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems.

Our approach to tackling the significant challenge of Net Zero 2030 is guided by three Christian values: 
* **Discipleship**
* **Justice**
* **Hope**

As we join together in this shared journey, it is hoped they will also sustain us for the journey ahead. Collectively, they are the lens through which we see the task ahead.
