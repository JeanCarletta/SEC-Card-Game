<p>One way of making people comfortable is applying heat to the people instead of trying to heat the entire space - like with heated car seats. Some churches are moving to heated pew cushions. There are both small rechargeable ones and ones that are wired permanently into the mains.Â  You can also get panel heaters that mount vertically on, for instance, the back of pews and on altars.</p>
