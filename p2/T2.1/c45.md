If you can’t address heat loss, it doesn’t make sense to try to heat the air and keep it in the building.  Instead, you could install infrared panels that act like mini suns for use just when people are in.  There are churches that use them successfully as the sole heating in worship spaces, halls, and offices.  The system must be carefully designed with the right wave length for the space, and it works better if the furniture doesn’t block the heat.
