<h1>Replace your boiler with a heat pump</h1>

<p>Heat pumps take heat from the outside air or ground using the same kind of technology as refrigerators, but in reverse. Installing pumps is expensive but there are grants available and if you can raise the costs, the running costs make it worth it.  They usually warm water but they can warm the air directly.   You may need underfloor heating unless you have low heat loss, generous radiators, and pipework big enough to deliver the  heat using lower temperature water than on your old system.  </p>
