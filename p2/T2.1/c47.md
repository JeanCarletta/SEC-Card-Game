<h1>Connect to a heating district network</h1>

<p>In district heating, the heat is generated elsewhere in the neighbourhood and delivered via insulated pipes. You may be able to find information about plans for future low carbon heating networks for your city or local region that use waste heat from electricity generation or industrial processes, or low carbon technologies with efficiencies of scale.Â  Expect an expensive building retrofit. Just like a heat pump, district heating delivers heat at lower temperatures than our current boilers, so it often requires underfloor heating and good use of heat loss measures. </p>
