# Structure of the toolkit (Petals, Tasks and Cards)
There are ten categories (we call them "Petals") within the toolkit. These are based on the ten pillars of the Net Zero Action Plan (2023-2023). 

<!--  Needs a picture.  Doesn't matter that they've seen it already, it's still better than a list.
These petals are:
  1. Energy Efficiency Improvements
  2. Clean Energy
  3. Thriving Biodiversity
  4. Active Travel
  5. Zero Waste
  6. Shared Goverance
  7. Training & Education
  8. Rooted Worship
  9. Positive Finances
  10. Build A Movement

Within each of these petal categories there are a number of specific tasks, which provide a suggested direction for helping to achieve the objectives within the Net Zero Action Plan. 

<!-- Replace thils paragraph -->
As the focus on this plan in the near term is concentrated on Energy Effieciency Improvements and Clean Energy, these tasks also have a set of 'cards' associated with them. Each card provides further detail on the specific actions required to support the tasks, along with links to supporting resources and information.

<!-- with this motivating text

Reducing energy use in our buildings is particularly urgent, because it's hard to know what to do and some changes are expensive.   At the moment, energy prices are rising so fast that thinking now makes good financial sense, plus there are generous government grants for the more expensive changes that won't last forever.  So for these tasks, we also have a set of **cards** you can use that will help you make the right choices.

<!-- and they like home crowds and tested systems, tell them this is good stuff. -->

The cards were designed by a property volunteer in one of our churches based on her experiences in about twenty churches and halls.  Her first set of cards have already been used by around 25 churches and community centres around the UK.  They tell us using them is fun and makes planning for the future much easier.

<!-- this image is off-putting to anyone but scientists and confusing, no steps.  If we need it, we should replace it with something that just gives an example from the first petal first step.  -->
