When it comes to actions that affect your premises, sustainability experts say there is an ideal order.  For instance, any changes that address heat loss in a building usually come before specifying a new decarbonised heating system, because the heating system can then be smaller.  To make it easier to understand the order, we indicate this order using six "steps".  

If a task or card isn't assigned to a step, there is no recommended order and you can take it at any time without considering other prior actions.
