<h1>Install temporary secondary glazing</h1>

<p>If you don’t need to open the windows in winter for ventilation, it is possible to cut polycarbonate sheets to the size of the window reveal and mount them inside, for instance, using magnetic tape. A good polycarbonate should last ten years without discolouring.  It scratches and you’ll need to find a place to store it in the summer if you can’t leave it up.  This isn’t as good as proper glazing, but it will make a noticeable difference to single glazing especially if the windows don’t fit well.  </p>
