<p>It’s expensive and difficult to heat air and keep it in an old leaky building.  Even if your building is so well used you can afford heat loss measures, your building could be difficult to treat.  Try the infrared panel and heated seating cards plus approaches that reduce the impact of really cold surfaces, like carpets, curtains and wall hangings. Although these do heat the air some, they mostly make people comfortable through radiation or conduction, so they reduce draughts and make heat loss much less important. Running costs are also proportional to space use, reducing financial risk.</p>
