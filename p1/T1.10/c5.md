<p>It’s obvious why this makes sense - the hard part is understanding why the doors are open.   If users just forget to close the door, a cheap hydraulic door closer might help.  If groups feel it must be open to welcome people, you might be able to install a glass panel so newcomers can see what is happening inside the space.   If users struggle to enter the space unaided, then you will need either a more expensive automatic door or to station someone at the door to help. </p>
