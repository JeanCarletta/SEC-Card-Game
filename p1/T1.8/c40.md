<p>Lights in community buildings are frequently left on by accident. If the light switch also controls an extractor fan, this can waste a lot of heating. </p><p>Some lights and fans have motion sensing built in. For others, you can have an electrician add a separate motion sensor.  They can sense movement up to 30 feet away, so can be used in relatively large rooms, and don’t take much power to run. Alternatively, if electric heating also gets left on, you could change to hotel-style keycards that control whether electricity is supplied to some circuits.</p>
