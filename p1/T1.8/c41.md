<h1>Put countdown timers on some electrics</h1>

<p>Electric heating and urns often get left on, even overnight.  You can buy special “countdown timer” or “time delay push” switches that will only supply electricity to a device for a set amount of time before the user will need to use the switch again. Sometimes you set the amount of time for the switch and sometimes the switch gives the user several choices - for instance, power for 1, 2, or 3 hours. If a bunch of electrical devices should come on together, consider having one switch for them all.</p>
