<h1>Provide maintenance contact details</h1>

<p>When users don’t know who to contact, they take things into their own hands. Even if your controls let them do the right thing, that probably means bringing in space heaters, turning on the oven and hob to warm the space, and blocking exits open with fire extinguishers. You need to know what problems they’re having and to be able to get detailed descriptions if there are issues that a worker needs to sort out for you. If you have occasional or loosely managed user groups in, you may need signage with a contact number.</p>
