<h1>Change to point-of-use hot water on demand</h1>

<p>Electric point-of-use hot water heaters only heat the hot water you need on demand. That’s a good change if you have an old, badly insulated tank that could fail soon or if you can’t predict when hot water is needed.  It can also be good if you have a condensing boiler that you are only running at high temperature to keep the tank safe, or if there aren’t many taps and they’re a long way from the tank.  If your hot water heating is currently on a timer, at least make sure the times are right for you.</p>
