<p>If air can’t move through a radiator or fan convector, they won’t heat the space.  Don’t let users pile things around them.  Also, dusty radiators won’t shed heat as fast as they should.  Check any fins especially. Dust in fan convectors is even worse because it can damage them.  Clean or change the filters regularly. </p><p>If a radiator gets warm at the bottom but not the top, it needs bleeding when the system is cold and off.  If it is cold at the bottom or there are leaks anywhere,  you should get that fixed.  </p>
