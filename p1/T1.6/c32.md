<h1>Control your fan convectors</h1>

<p>Fan convectors are often set to dump heat too fast, making people uncomfortable because the heating bangs on and off.  They usually have controls that let you set the fan speed and slow it down when the space is approaching the right temperature, which is a form of “load compensation” to keep it from overshooting.  To find the controls, you might need to take the cover off.  While you’re in there, don’t forget to clean the filter!  </p>
