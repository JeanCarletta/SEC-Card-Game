<h1>Zone your heating</h1>

<p>Zoning means making it possible to set timings for the heating that apply to less than the whole building.  That used to mean motorised valves and separate pipework to different spaces.  A more modern approach is to use “smart” radiator valves that let you programme the heating in each room independently.  That isn’t as efficient as proper zoning, but it’s much cheaper and less disruptive.</p><p>Zoning also helps with electric radiators and radiant panels to make sure you or your users can bring on just the right ones at the right times.  </p>
