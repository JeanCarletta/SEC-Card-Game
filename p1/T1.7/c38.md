<h1>Reduce the size of heated spaces</h1>

<p>Many community buildings have high ceilings.  Putting in a false ceiling can substantially reduce the amount of heating you need. If it’s not possible to insulate the roof, false ceilings can be doubly attractive as it might be possible to insulate them in a “cold roof” design. </p><p> Similarly, if you have no option but to put small groups in large spaces, finding a way to partition them into smaller ones - either permanently or as needed - can reduce your heating bills and might increase your income. Architects tell us churches need more ambitious briefs to serve their communities well.  </p>
