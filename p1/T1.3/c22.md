<p>A professional assessment will help you prioritise your actions - but keep in mind the assessors can't always tailor their advice to how you use your building or how that might change in the future.  For your housing,  you should obtain an up-to-date EPC survey and also review guidance on the Scottish Episcopal Church's minimum standards for rectories.  For other modest buildings, you could use a free energy efficiency assessment from Business Energy Scotland. For larger, listed buildings you may wish to consider getting a survey by a qualified Mechanical and Electrical Engineer via the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. </p>
