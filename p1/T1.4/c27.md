What to do for this card depends on whether you have a hot water cylinder (storage tank) or something that supplies hot water on demand - either a combi-boiler or a point-of-service hot water heater. <br/>Hot water cylinders have to be kept above 60C to deter Legionella bacteria. This usually means setting your boiler thermostat at 70C or higher.<br/>If the hot water isn’t being stored, then you can set it for what feels right at the taps.  50C is a good starting point.
