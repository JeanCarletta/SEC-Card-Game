<p>Lots of buildings waste energy by not matching the heating well enough to when people are in.  In addition, turning the heating off well before the last people leave means the system won’t waste energy trying to bring the space back up to temperature just because the door has been open.  If you struggle to get the timings right with your current system, consider updating your heating controls.  Some models let you set the times over the internet and “optimised start control” would mean you don’t have to predict how long the space will take to warm up.</p>
