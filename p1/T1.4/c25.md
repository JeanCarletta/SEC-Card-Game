<h1>Check your frost arrangements</h1>

<p>Heating a building to preserve it is a last resort.  Most wet heating systems can protect themselves by turning on just the pumps or warming the water very gently. Keeping the building dry and well-ventilated is often enough for the building and its contents, especially if you can insulate any vulnerable water pipes.  Your architect can advise you.  If you really  have to introduce heat, it’s much more efficient to install controls that will enforce a minimum “setback” temperature than to turn the heating on a little bit every day.  </p>
