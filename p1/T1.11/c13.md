<h1>Insulate the walls</h1>

<p>Wall insulation can be outside, inside, or in the cavity within the wall.  The right way to insulate a wall depends on the context.   If you can insulate externally, that’s usually the most effective solution.  With traditional mass masonry walls, you need the insulation to be breathable and there are more options than you might think.  You could have cellulose pellets blown behind the lathe and plaster, insulation applied to the existing masonry, plaster, or wall linings, or a timber frame that holds insulation in place, making a big space a bit smaller.</p>
