<h1>Make surfaces warmer</h1>

<p>Historically, soft furnishings have been used to reduce the impact of really cold surfaces.  This works because fabrics warm up much faster than stone and present a warmer surface that doesn't soak up your body heat so quickly.  Carpets, seat cushions, wall tapestries, and chairs that cocoon the sitter to get between their head and the ceiling are all approaches that have stood the test of time.  Of course it's not like having central heating, but they do help.</p>
