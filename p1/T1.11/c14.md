You don’t want to lose heat to the wrong spaces.  Unless your pipes are contributing useful heating, they should be insulated, including in the boiler room.  A good installer will insulate all the tricky bits of pipework, not just the straight lengths.</br>  It’s also important to insulate hot water cylinders.  Modern cylinders often have hardened foam insulation but older ones might need more.  The modern standard is 80mm.  You can “top up” with a cylinder jacket of the right size.
