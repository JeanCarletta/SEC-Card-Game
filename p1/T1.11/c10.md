If a radiator is mounted on a cold external wall, it will lose much of the heat to the wall, not to the air in the room. There are products you can mount behind these radiators with foil on one side and insulation on the other. They help by reflecting the heat back into the room.   It’s nowhere near as good as insulating the wall, but at least it’s cheap and easy to do while you organise bigger changes.
