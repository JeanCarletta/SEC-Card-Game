What to do for this card depends on whether you have a hot water cylinder (storage tank) or something that supplies hot water on demand - either a combi-boiler or a point-of-service hot water heater. 

Hot water cylinders have to be kept above 60C to deter Legionella bacteria. This usually means setting your boiler thermostat at 70C or higher.

If the hot water isn’t being stored, then you can set it for what feels right at the taps.  50C is a good starting point.
